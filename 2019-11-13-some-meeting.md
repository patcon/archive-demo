### Discussions

- IDRC devops opportunity (patcon)
    - Notes from call: https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing-private/blob/master/2019-11-12-idrc-devops.md
    - Possible aligns with us
    - Temporary position, could be contracted later (leaning towrds co-op)
    - 35/hour week 1 year contract - devops
    - How does inra work in an open environment
    - Union job - given to 1 person
    - 20% time - that could be used for converstaions that are less structured
    - Could it be 1 person takes but supported by "peer support group" - possibly allot of support for this
    - Possibly - Pat takes the roll and pays coop for its time

    - dc: this is not a hypha opportunity
       - PC: legaly - not a hypha thing
       - PC: reallity its a "hack" to share 1 union position between multiple people
   - bl: legal language could be a blocker
   - dw: dont know until you see the languange in the contract. Union may be strickter, but not what we should lead with
   - bl: onboarding is hard enough, adding distributed work adds overhad to the job. 
   - bl: Feels sub projects may work but leaning on hypha excusivly is not work 
   - dc: 10 from dawn
   - yj: willing to help but cannot commit specific hours, think it's right up patcon's alley
   - bl: no block, not personally participating
   - el: seems interested in the work
- rough dec'n making steps (dc)
    - e.g. 2 recent decisions:
        1. Applying for credit card (early discussions, gh issue and parallel chat convos that didn't have a clear outcome, dec'n on call)
        2. Payroll (proposal document, one-on-one review, gh issue, [poll on loomio](https://loomio.hypha.coop/p/pVeoE53O/how-often-should-we-do-payroll-))
    - dc: forensics on past decisions?
        - bl: felt like maybe "reverse decision-making". doc first. not proposal. flagged discussion that went backward to gihub/loomio.
        - dc: just want shared practices.
- discuss our communication tools & task workflow (ben) so we can reduce noise for everyone and appropriately assign decision-making power to WGs:
    - [**Proposal**](https://github.com/hyphacoop/handbook/blob/coordination/coordination.md) for [When to use which communication tool](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/132)
        - talked about deprioritizing loomio on last call
        - challenge: tagging wg labels doesn't ping
    - [Improve task workflow](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/140)
    - [Time tracking practices](https://loomio.hypha.coop/d/iE1VYzgZ/tool-talk-time-tracking/35)

### Discussion Parking Lot

- credit card reimbursement process (yurko)
- employee READMEs (patcon)
- jitsi: is it working? (elon+ben)
